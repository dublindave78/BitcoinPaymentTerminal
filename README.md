# Bitcoin Payment Terminal 💸

This is a smarter **bitcoin payment terminal** that **updates** the price of the transaction **based on the actual price of bitcoin**. It doesn't actually make the transaction.

## The Why ✔️

This solves the problem of **Bitcoin's volatility** when selling/buying something in Bitcoin. It also avoids the need to use security funds to compensate customers for the loss of Bitcoin in a transaction due to volatility.

## What does it look like ✨

As you can see, when I refresh the page, the price of bitcoin updates. So the price adapts to the actual Bitcoin Price. 

## How to use it ⚒️

- Download the folder on an empty file
- Open the ```pay.html``` file
